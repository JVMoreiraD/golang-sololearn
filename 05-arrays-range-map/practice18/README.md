# Multiple Inputs

The **make()** function allows you to make dynamically sized arrays, which can use the **append()** function to add new elements to it.
This is useful when, for example, you need to take multiple inputs and store them in an array.

Your program needs to take a number, indicating the number of inputs, followed by those inputs. The input numbers should be stored in an array and be outputted as the result of the program.

**Sample Input:**
     
```markdown
8
0
5
```



**Sample Output:**

```markdown
[42 88 11]
```



> The first number indicates that there are going to be **3** numbers as input.
